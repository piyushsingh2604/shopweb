In the first semester of my first year of university, I was given an assignment called "**Responsive Website**"for the module '**Introduction to Web Development**'. The task was
difficult as I did not have any previous experience when it came to coding websites until this point. However, I was still able to make a fairly nice-looking, semi-responsive
website. which outlines 10 weeks of learning various HTML and CSS fundamentals. This website contains the code & images that I used for my submssion, with some very minor tweaks
to make it appropriate for public access. I do plan on updating this README and the site itself, as I was unfortunately not skilled enough at the time to make the site fully
responsive.
