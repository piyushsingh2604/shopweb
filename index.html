                    <p id="P1">In the first week of web development, we learned about the very basic fundamentals of HTML (Hypertext
                        Markup Language) and briefly went over CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which we will use to design our websites. HTML and CSS 
                        are the standard languages that are used to structure and style websites. HTML uses things called 'tags' to identify
                        and decide which function to assign something. With a few exceptions, almost all tags require an 'end tag' which contain a '/'
                        so that they are distinguishable from their matching start tag. Start and end tags are used to nest the specified content, 
                        and also assign it a function. In a nutshell, HTML has various tags for different purposes, so that it can efficiently
                        structure a webpage.</p>
                    
                    <p id="P2">We were also taught how to access Brighton Domains so that we can navigate to the correct folders in order to upload our
                        updated versions of the website. The first thing that we created was a 'text/HTML' file called 'index.html', which contains 
                        the main source code.Next, we made 3 folders called 'ci435', 'images' and 'css'. The ci435 folder stays within the 'public_html'
                        directory, and the other 2 folders are moved inside of it, along with index.html. This is done so that we can work on our 
                        websites in an organized fashion without losing track of our work.</p>

                    <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">HTML5 Markup Basics</h4>   
            
                    <p>This week, we learned the basics of HTML markup, which includes: syntax (rules) of tags, blocks, inline
                        elements and how to create well-formed markup. HTML has what's called a 'lax' syntax meaning that it is 'backwards compatible'. 
                        This essentially means that obsolete tags such as 'u' and 'font' are still recognized and used correctly by the translator; however, they are almost never
                        used any more. This is due to the fact that CSS makes styling much easier, and specifies how the browser's content should be presented. 
                        The way that the languages are integrated is by referencing the CSS stylesheet in the head of the HTML document.</p> 
                        
                    <p>If a website's presentation is defined solely in a stylesheet, it is far easier to edit an entire website's styling rather than finding and 
                        editing every tag's attribute styles individually. This will be explained in more detail in a later post. One of the most important things in 
                        web-development is creating well-formed markup. To do this, elements must be correctly nested inside one another, and laid out efficiently enough 
                        so that the developer can read between their own code. This screenshot from the (current) source code shows this:</p>
                    
                        <img src="images/weekslayout.PNG" alt="Source Code Layout" id="Code-Layout-SS">
                        
                    <p id="P4">We also learned about 'anchors' and the 'href' attribute. The anchor is what outlines the clickable link,
                        and the 'href' (meaning hypertext reference) is the links destination, which must be included in the HTML source code.
                        This is crucial because we are required to have 3 different pages on our website that must be linked together using
                        these anchors. Block and inline elements are simple. Block elements e.g. 'h1' (headings), 'p' (paragraphs), 'ol' and 'ul' (lists) are
                        elements that are always in the HTML document, and can nest inline elements and other block elements inside of them. Inline elements
                        such as 'em' and 'strong' cannot contain block elements, only other inline elements. Tags and their attribute names should always be lower case. 
                        For example, my folders 'ci435' and 'images' were not named with any capitals because XML is case sensitive when differentiating
                        tags and their attribute values.</p>

                    <p><small>P.S. It makes no difference to the HTML translator, but if things are not laid out correctly, the developer
                        might get confused when trying to fix something</small></p>

                    <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">HTML5 Document Structure and Hypertext</h4>
                    
                    <p>During week 3, we covered the 'div' element, how the Learning Journal should be structured, absolute & relative 
                        links and the 'viewport' meta command. To create a well-structured Learning Journal (or website), elements must be correctly nested inside
                        one another. For example, 'header' is the main title of the page, and should be located at the top. As we already know, an element is made up of 
                        start and end tags, with content in-between.</p>
                        
                    <p id="P6">The body of the page consists of 'section elements', which are used to identify/ separate different 
                        types of content, to make the site more readable. The 'article' tag outlines the informative content of the page, meaning it nests things like
                        paragraphs and embedded images. The 'main' tag is used to mark-up the main content that is unique to <em>that</em> specific page, 
                        not the entire website. For the Learning Journal, things like 'References' and the nav bar would not be included in 'main'. 'Aside' is essentially
                        the opposite of 'main', since it nests the primary content of the website, which we just went over. Finally the 'footer' 
                        of the website is located at the bottom, and may include bibliography, copyrights and contact info. Using this diagram,
                        developers can create well-structured websites.</p>

                        <img src="images/layoutdiagram.jpg" alt="HTML Website Layout" id="HTML-Layout-Diagram">
        
                    <p id="P7">Two of the most important tag attributes in any webpage are 'class' and 'id'. They are very different,
                        however, they are used similarly. The 'class' attribute refers to all tags with that same class name, meaning that the <strong>same</strong> class
                        attribute can be applied to <strong>multiple</strong> tags. This is extremely useful for developers and saves them a lot of work, because 
                        it means that instead of styling every tag individually, one class can be made with a specific rule-set that applies to all tags containing it.</p>
                        <div id="#WK3-Diagram-Reference"></div>
                    <p id="P8">The 'id' attribute is only used to target <strong>one</strong> tag to provide it with a unique set of rules, which only apply to that specific
                        tag. One scenario where a developer would use id instead of class would be if they wanted to float an image to the right of a paragraph
                        (like the one above). That paragraph can still have a class, but would also have an id to make <em>it</em>, and <em>only</em> it float to 
                        the left of the image. The screenshots below show the classes, id's and corresponding stylesheets of the paragraph and image above.</p>

                    <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Cascading Style Sheets</h4>
                
                    <p>We covered many things in week 4, including: CSS 3 syntax, embedded and inline styling, 'selectors', inheritance and 
                        specificity and the 'normalize.css' stylesheet. Although it is a very efficient and logical formatting language, HTML alone, has some limitations. 
                        This is because all it can really do is define things such as titles, lists, paragraphs; embed images, videos etc. This is where Cascading 
                        Style Sheets comes in. Nowadays, it is solely used to edit the layout and presentation of webpages, and it does 
                        this by interacting with the HTML tags, as we already know. Certain styles used to only be possible using JavaScript, or photo-shopping
                        images beforehand, but with CSS 3, developers are now able to apply the following styles:</p>

                        <ul class="All-Content-Lists">
                            <li>Shadow on text and boxes</li>
                            <li>Opacity settings using rgba</li>
                            <li>The 'border-radius' attribute</li>
                            <li>Decorative borders</li>
                            <li>Importing fonts from the internet</li>
                            <li>Gradients</li>
                            <li>Animations (transition & transform)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>CSS also has some very important syntax rules. For example, classes are defined with a dot (.) in a stylesheet document, whereas id's are
                        defined with a hashtag (#). In the stylesheet doc, the name of the classes and id's are known as selectors, because they select the specific tag and tag-type
                        that the developer wants to style. The diagram in <a class="Content-Rel-Links" href="#Week-3">Week 3</a> is an example of this. 
                        Another rule would be  that specific types of styling can only be applied to certain elements e.g. 'border-radius' can only be applied to elements that already 
                        have an existing background/ image/ border, as it wouldn't make sense to try to apply it to anything else.</p>
                        
                    <p>Embedded and inline styling is very simple. Embedded styling is when the styling properties are <strong>literally</strong> embedded into an HTML document using 
                        the 'style' tag. This should <strong>only</strong> be done if the developer is creating a <strong>single-page website</strong>. Inline styling (which is how this 
                        website is styled) is when a HTML5 document has a reference in the 'head' to a separate text/css document. The HTML doc would have lots and lots of classes and 
                        id's which would contain all styling properties for the website's elements. The applying styles for only classes and id's is known as specificity. This is 
                        because the class/id is more specific than inherited styling i.e. '.p {font-size: 12px;}' would set all paragraphs of text to have a font size of 12 pixels, 
                        <em>until</em> a specified class/id overrules it.</p>

                    <p><small>P.S. The 'normalize.css' stylesheet is what's known as a 'reset' stylesheet. Since different & older versions of browsers don't recognize all HTML5 elements,
                        all that normalize.css does, is render the elements more consistently and up-to-date with modern standards. It also only targets the styles that need normalizing.</small></p>

                    <p>In week 5, we covered:</p>

                    <ul class="All-Content-Lists">

                                <li>vw & vh</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5 class="All-Weekly-Headers">The 'cascade' specificity</h5>
                    <p>The cascade specificity is another set of rules, which is about how browsers determine which styling rule(s) to apply to a specific
                        element or multiple elements. The screenshot on the right, which was taken from the source code of this website is an example of this. There are rules being 
                        applied to the body of the website, and also the paragraphs. 

                    <p id="P10">For this demonstration, I temporarily added conflicting font families for the preset styles of 
                        the body and paragraphs of the website. The reason that I put a cross next to the bodies' font family, and a tick next to the paragraphs' one, is because the 
                        paragraph's styling rules <strong>override</strong> the bodies'. This is because paragraphs should always be located within the body, therefore making 
                        them <strong>more specific</strong> than the body of a page. If a developer does not want a specific title or paragraph to inherit the default styles that they 
                        set, they should give it a class or id depending on the purpose. </p>

                    <img src="images/cssboxmodelss.jpg" alt="CSS Box Model Example" id="CSS-Box-Model-SS">
                    <p>This screenshot is an example of the CSS box model for this page in the website. With some rough annotations, I have tried to break it down to make it 
                        easier to visualize the box model. The 'Menu-Container' class consists of the websites' references (left container) and, in this case, the weekly content navigation 
                        (right container). Using the box model is very useful for developers, as it allows them to <em>easily</em> reposition/resize the containers for different viewports,
                        or in my case, creating two different boxes of content with the same styles but different positions. I did this by giving both containers different classes for
                        different purposes. The 'Left-Container' and 'Right-Container' classes specify the positioning and size of each, and the 'Container-Styles' class assigns
                        the containers some basic preset styles. These cannot be included in the same class because, although I want the styling the same, I also want the containers to
                        float left and right of the main content, meaning they need <strong>different</strong> locations

                    <p><strong>em & rem - relative to the font size of the element/root element,</strong> e.g. if a document's font size is 14px, 2rem would be 28px as it is 2x the size
                        of the root element, whereas em is relative to whatever its <strong>parent</strong> element is.</p>
                    <p><strong>vw & vh - relative to 1% of the viewports width/height</strong> e.g. 1vw is larger on a tablet than on a smartphone, equally, 1vh on a desktop monitor
                        would be larger than 1vh on a tablet.</p>

                    <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Introduction to Responsive Web Design</h4>
                
                    <p>This week was all about keeping the website responsive/ optimized for devices of all different screen-sizes. As previously talked about, the 'viewport' meta
                        command allows developers to scale the <strong>width</strong> of the viewport to the correct screen-size of the specified device. The reason that only the width
                        is talked about is because the website's content can be rearranged to be further up or down on the page, and can be navigated to via scrolling and/ or a button.  
                        By default, doing this may cause certain things to be mispositioned or incorrectly-sized. This is where HTML/CSS 'media queries' come in.</p>

                        <h5 id="HTML-Subtitle-2">HTML (Conditional) Media Query:</h5>
                        <img src="images/htmlmediaqueryss.PNG" alt="HTML Media Query Example" id="HTML-MQ-SS">
                        <div id="Separator-3"></div>
                        <h5 id="CSS-Subtitle-2">CSS (Specific) Media Query:</h5>  
                        <img src="images/cssmediaqueryss.PNG" alt="CSS Media Query Example" id="CSS-MQ-SS">

                    <p>A media query is essentially an 'if' statement, of sorts; and can apply conditions to an entire stylesheet and/ or for a specific element/ set of elements within a 
                        stylesheet. These screenshots above are examples of both. The first one was taken from this pages HTML doc 'index.html', and is <strong>only</strong> applied to 
                        the website under certain conditions. In this case, the conditions for the referenced stylesheets 'index.css' and 'tablet.css' are that they can only apply when the 
                        devices screen-width is between a certain number of pixels. Index.css uses 'min-width: 947px' and 'max-width: 1920px' since these are the standard widths for most laptop 
                        and desktop monitors, and I only want index.css to apply to those screens. Tablet.css works in the same way, however
                        
                    <p>The other media query, which should be put in the CSS doc, is an example of more specific media query. In this case, the paragraph floats to the left of the image by 
                        default. However, as the viewport shrinks, the paragraph starts to look very squashed and narrow. To fix this, I added a cut off point using '(max-width: 1100px)' 
                        so that when the viewport is any less than 1100 pixels, the image no longer floats to the right. Instead, the image is displayed in the center, below the image.
                        The reason I didn't add a 'min-width' argument is because it is already defined in the HTML doc, and if I did add one and it was any larger than 947 pixels, it 
                        would revert back to floating before getting to the minimum width.</p>

                    <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Flexible Media</h4>
                
                    <p>Week 7 was the progress-check week, which involved the web development lecturers providing some casual feedback on the Fridays of weeks 8, 9 and 10 (in our tutorial sessions).
                        My knowledge of HTML and CSS was very basic at this time, as I've learned a lot more about both languages since then. I distinctly remember forgetting to show evidence of HTML/CSS 
                        validation, which is why I will definitely show evidence of validation on the 15th :). We were told to create a zip file containing the ci435 folder, and our (now) 3 text/html 
                        files: index.html, tutorial.html and contact.html. These are the three pages of the website, which were linked using <strong>relative links</strong>. A relative link sends the 
                        user to another page/ place within the same website, whereas an <strong>external</strong> link sends the user to a different website altogether.
                    
                    <p>We also learned about 'flexible media'. Flexible media is about making the embedded images and videos of the website responsive. This can be done in a
                        multitude of ways, the two best ways that I've found are using min-width and max-width and using media queries. In this case, I have used media queries for the informative 
                        images on this page, and min-width & max-width for the ones on the Tutorial page. For more information about media queries, see <a class="Content-Rel-Links" href="#Week-6">Week 6</a>.
                        Whether the developer is using min-width, max-width, media queries, or both; the width of the image should always be defined. To make the image 'flexible' for min and max-width, 
                        the developer <strong>must</strong> use a relative unit of measurement, such as %, so that it fits in its container no matter the viewport size, and also cannot exceed or fall 
                        below the specified minimum and maximum widths. The new height of the image is automatically recalculated depending on the change in width, so as long as <strong>only</strong> 
                        the width style is included, the image will not look stretched.</p>

                        <h5 class="Flex-Media-Sub">Image & Paragraph 1101px and above:</h5>
                        <img src="images/flexiblemediass1.PNG" alt="Image Floating Right of Paragraph" id="Flexible-Media-Pic-1">
                        <h5 class="Flex-Media-Sub">Image & Paragraph 1100px and below:</h5>
                        <img src="images/flexiblemediass2.PNG" alt="Image Underneath Paragraph" id="Flexible-Media-Pic-2">

                    <p>An alternative to this is using media queries, which can include relative or static measurements for the image sizes. This is convenient for developers as it allows them
                        to resize and reposition any image, for any given screen width. Although, one issue with using relative units of measurement is that the images shrink in proportion to the width
                        of the screen, until another media query (which would resize the image) is implemented. This <em>does</em> mean that the images would be slightly smaller before that cut-off point, 
                        however, as long as the image is still readable <strong>on said screen</strong>, this shouldn't be too much of a problem. When using static/ absolute units of measurement 
                        such as millimeters or centimeters, the image will always remain its given size, regardless of the screens', meaning the image would have to be positioned in a way where 
                        it never would overlap the site's content.</p>

                    <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Responsive Layout</h4>
                
                    <p>The whole point of media queries is to ensure that the website's content remains readable, and easily accessible across all the possible devices that a potential user/ customer could
                        view the website on. In week 8, we were taught about the 'flexbox layout' and 'multi-columns'. These are common ways that a developer would lay out their website in order to make it 
                        fully responsive, meanwhile keeping it simple. The flexbox layout is referred to as a 'card interface', which either have 1, 2 or 3 columns for the website's content, depending on
                        the device. For a laptop/ desktop view, there would be 3 columns, for tablets, 2 and smartphones would typically have just a single column. This is why almost all developers keep
                        their website's navigation in a fixed position; because even if the user is on a smaller device e.g. an iPhone 6, they are still able to navigate to other parts of the website no
                        matter how far they scroll. This is convenient and provides a good user experience, so it's a win-win for the user and developer.</p>

                        <h5 class="Website-View-Subtitle">Website on a Desktop:</h5>
                        <img src="images/website1920px.PNG" alt="Website Desktop View" id="px1920">

                        <img src="images/website375px.PNG" alt="Website Mobile View" id="px375">
                    
                    <p>Although I was unable to make the website fully responsive, these screenshots are meant to be indicators of how I wanted the website to look for each device and device variant.
                        What I mean by 'device variant' are all the different types of each device. For example, the smartphone view is only optimized for the iPhone 6, 7 and 8 as, unfortunately, I did not
                        have time to make the website responsive for the iPhone X, 11, 12 or any of the Galaxy or Huawei phones. Similarly, the tablet view is only optimized for the Apple iPad, but not
                        the iPad Pro. The desktop view should work on all kinds of monitors, as I had the time to make media queries to fix any layout issues for smaller monitors.</p>
                        
                    <p>Changing the layout of the website for different devices requires quite a bit of imagination, since the developer must bear in mind that the layout should remain convenient, but 
                        also readable. This is why I have followed the flexbox layout rule, as it seemed, logically the best way to do this. Due to the screen being much smaller, I had to make a subtle 
                        change to the websites' containers for the smartphone view. Instead of being fixed, at the side, the content navigation is located at the top of the website, so that as soon as a 
                        user enters the Learning Journal or Tutorial Page, they can instantly navigate to their chosen week/ quarantine study tip. The 'References' container is below <a class="Content-Rel-Links"
                        href="#Week-10">Week 10</a> in the smartphone version because even though it is important, it is not as high-a-priority as the website's navigation, since it's part of the website's 
                        <strong>functionality</strong></p>

                    <h5 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Role of Forms in Websites</h5>
                    <p>Website forms are <strong>essential</strong> for both functionality, and interactivity. The presence of a form turns casual website browsers into potential customers. The more engaging
                        and responsive a form is, the more likely a customer is to fill it out. When a customer fills out a form, the business can then use the information provided, to get a more accurate
                        representation of what their customers want. This is called data mining, it is a huge part of digital marketing, and is <strong>very</strong> beneficial for the business in question.</p>

                    <h5 class="All-Weekly-Headers">HTML Form Elements</h5>
                    <p>All form elements must be nested inside the 'form' element. The form element must have an 'action' attribute, as this is what specifies the website's Uniform Resource Indicator, which
                        processes information that users put into the form. Another essential attribute in the form element is the 'method' attribute, which can either be 'get' or 'post'. These are the HTTP
                        methods for submitting form data to the server. The 'input' element is where the interactive part comes in. There are various types of input, each one used to specify the type of control 
                        (widget) to display, and the type of data that is allowed to be typed into the widget. The types of inputs include:</p>

                        <img src="images/inputtypestable.PNG" alt="Input Types Table" id="Input-Types">

                    <p>For example, the 'email' input type is a text field that requires an '@' symbol in the typing area, and the 'password' is a text field with a control type that obscures the data entered, 
                        and cannot contain line breaks (spaces). The 'label' element is pretty self explanatory, it is used to label the input type, to make it readable to for the user. For the 'Your Experience'
                        fieldset, I have used the radio type for the contact form in the website, which only allows the user to select one of the multiple checkboxes. This is so that when the user gets to the 
                        question 'Did you enjoy the website?', they can only choose 1 of 3 options: 'Yes', 'No' or 'Kind of'. In order to have a valid HTML5 form, it must have required fields. The developer can
                        add the boolean (true or false) 'required' attribute to accomplish this. One last handy attribute, to make the form more interactive is 'placeholder'. It displays text inside the widget 
                        until the user starts typing, which usually has a word or phrase to briefly let them know how to fill in the field.</p>

                    <h5 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Styling forms with CSS</h5>
                    <p>Since forms are part of the functionality and interactivity of the website, it is important that they provide a good user experience. Styling the form was not too difficult. I had to bear 
                        in mind that it must fit with the theme of the contact page, and also be laid out conveniently and responsively. Using a class for the general text fields, such as first name, last name
                        and email, I made it so that each field's colour is set to black, with a 2-pixel green border and a 2mm gap between each field and its label. I also gave both fieldsets the 'display: block'
                        style, so that all fields inside are displayed vertically downwards rather than horizontally.</p>

                    <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Testing and Evaluating</h4>
                
                    <p>Week 10 was about testing and evaluating the website. Since I came into this course with zero HTML/ CSS knowledge at all, I had to do a <strong>lot</strong> of testing. Every time I made a
                        change that I knew would alter the website considerably, I would always hit 'CTRL + S' to save the work, then switch to the local version in the browser and hit 'CTRL + R' to refresh it.
                        I did this so that I could constantly perform tests by switching between VSCode and the browser quickly and conveniently. In retrospect, I could have done a lot of things better on the
                        website, such as making the website responsive for all devices, and making the source code more concise. On the other hand, I also feel like I have done a decent job on the website, considering
                        that I have only been learning HTML/CSS since october.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the evaluation, we had to ensure that the website met all aims and objectives. These aims and objectives are essentially the user requirements of what would be in a generic website of this 
                        sort. In my case, this website has images, paragraphs, headers, sub headers, a form and 3 linked pages and a fixed navigation. These are the base requirements for a functional,
                        interactive website. We also had to ensure that we met the requirements of the brief, which was more specific. I solely based the making of the website on the brief and weekly
                        PowerPoints, so I can confidently say that this website meets most of the requirements set for the assessment.
