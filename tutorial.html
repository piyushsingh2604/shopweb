                </ul>

            <p id="Usage-Of-Time-Desc">One thing that is often overlooked in our society is the usage of time. We have limited time to fulfil our tasks each day, 
                efficiently, which is why creating and memorizing a table of your own weekly schedule is a great idea. This allows students to maximize their 
                productivity, because they are then aware of the times of day that they have lectures/ seminars/ tutorials, and also when they have spare time. 
                For example, on Wednesdays I frequently go to the Aldrich Library in the 2 hour gap that I have between lectures, so that I can practice JavaScript
                while it is still fresh in my mind after the programming lab session.</p>
                
            <p>After finishing the Computing Technologies lecture at 2:00, I often go to ALDI to get the food that I need for the week. Once I get back to my flat, 
                I'll put all the food away, relax for an hour or so, and then at around 4:00, either practice JavaScript or work on this HTML5/CSS3 website. I have 
                a lot of spare time on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, so I'll generally revise topics that I am struggling with at the time to get better at them.</p>

                <img src="images/wifisymbol.jpg" alt="Wi-Fi Symbol Image" class="Tutorial-Images">

            <p class="Tutorial-Paragraphs">Schools, colleges and universities across the world have been forced to switch and adapt to online learning due to the
                pandemic. This is a very sudden change, and as many know, it is very hard to cope with and nowhere near as engaging as in-person learning. This is
                why having a secure and stable internet connection is vital in times like these. Online classes are extremely improvised as it is, therefore ensuring
                a good connection allows students of all ages to make the most of online lessons, and in particular cases (like lectures), re-watch lessons, which was
                never really a thing until now. If your area/ home does not have very good internet, I personally find that turning on my smartphone's personal hotspot
                is a very good alternative. Using the internet for research shouldn't cut into your data plan, unless you stream vast amounts ofBec sound or video.

            <h4 class="All-Weekly-Headers">Eat and Sleep Well</h4>
        
                <img src="images/eatinghealthy.jpg" alt="Eating Healthy Image" class="Tutorial-Images">

            <p class="Tutorial-Paragraphs">During any lock-down/ quarantining periods, eating and sleeping well are an <strong>absolute priority</strong>. The key
                thing to remember throughout, is that this pandemic is <strong>temporary</strong>. Nobody wants to lose or gain unnecessary weight due to being stuck
                inside for a few weeks/ months, which is why buying the right food is important. Pasta and rice are perfect sources of carbs, and can be eaten with fish, 
                which accounts for protein, and of course, eat 5 fruits and vegetables per day. A good tip for the university students out there who want to get better at 
                budgeting: every time you buy a loaf of bread, buy another one to go in the freezer. Also, one  thing that cannot be stressed enough is sleeping well. 
                Sleeping allows our brain to recharge and recover so that it can be sharp and ready for the next day. A lack of sleep can slow down thought processes, cause 
                memory loss, and over long periods of time can have a profoundly bad effect on ones mental health. This is why 7 to 8 hours of sleep <strong>every</strong>
                night is needed to keep us productive :).</p>

                <img src="images/revisingcontent.jpg" alt="Revising Content Image" class="Tutorial-Images">

            <p class="Tutorial-Paragraphs">Although it may seem pointless, revising content that you are struggling with is one of the best things you can do. For example,
                when I started BSc Computer Science at Brighton, I had zero experience in most of the modules, however, I was somewhat aware of a few JavaScript and
                HTML concepts. Due to this, for the first 2-3 weeks of the course, I primarily studied and practiced SQL databases. This is because I knew that learning
                JavaScript and HTML would be easier for me than learning SQL, since it was completely new to me at the time. Once I had built up a basic knowledge of SQL,
                I then noticed that I was finding Cyber Security quite difficult, so I moved on to that. I found by November that I was more confident on the course overall,
                simply because I worked on the parts that I was previously finding difficult.</p>

                <img src="images/stayinguptodate.jpg" alt="Family Watching News Image" class="Tutorial-Images">

            <p class="Tutorial-Paragraphs">Lastly, but definitely not least, is staying up to date with regulations, and the current COVID-19 situation. Watching the news 
                for 20-30 mins per day will give students a better insight on what they should and should not do at the time. By 'regulations' I do not only mean the mainstream 
                media outlets, this also includes keeping up with  university emails. Students are expected to check their university emails daily, this is particularly useful
                if a student is unsure of current guidelines, and want to know more about <strong>their specific</strong> situation. Doing all of this may seem pointless to a 
                student, because the virus doesn't effect people under the age of 30 very badly. However when thinking about loved ones who are more at risk due to age/ an 
                underlying health condition, this ideology should not be supported.    </p>
